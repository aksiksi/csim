## csim

csim is a simple digital circuit simulator I'm working on for a course project.

### Goals

1. Simulation of digital circuits consisting of basic gates [done]
2. Generation of random circuits of `n` gates for testing purposes [in progress]
2. Optimize engine and data structures to allow simulation of upto 1 million gates with minimal memory usage [todo]
